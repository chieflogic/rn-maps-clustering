### üíª Pull Requests

We welcome pull requests! If you're ready to contribute code, please follow these steps:

1.  **Fork the Repository**
    Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.

2.  **Clone Your Fork**
    Clone your forked repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rn-maps-clustering.git
    cd rn-maps-clustering
    ```

3.  **Set Up the Development Environment**
    This project uses `pnpm` for package management. This single command will install dependencies for the root library and the example app.
    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4.  **Create a New Branch**
    Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. Use a descriptive name.

    # or
    git checkout -b fix/resolve-map-issue
    ```

5.  **Make Your Changes**
    Write your code! Make sure to follow the existing code style. All source code for the library is in the `src/` directory.

6.  **Test Your Changes**
    You can test your changes live in the `example/` app.
    ```bash
    # From the root directory
    pnpm example start
    ```
    This will start the Metro server for the example app, which you can run on a simulator or device.

7.  **Lint and Type-Check**
    Before committing, make sure your code passes the linter and TypeScript checks.
    ```bash
    # Run ESLint to check for code style issues
    pnpm lint

    # Run the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors
    pnpm typecheck
    ```

8.  **Commit Your Changes**
    Use a clear and descriptive commit message. This project follows the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.
